# Rektoff Launchpad

**Your guide to building, contributing, and working in the Solana security ecosystem**

Rektoff trains developers to think like attackers and build systems that don't break.

This page is your next step. It connects you with the Solana ecosystem, helps you find real work, and shows you how to contribute to live projects.

## Get Involved in the Solana Ecosystem

### Join your local community

[**superteam.fun**](https://superteam.fun/) — the best place to find your local Solana builder community. I cannot recommend this highly enough; This has absolutely and completely been the best way for me to connect with my local Solana/crypto community. Fun fact; parts of Rektoff were built during Solana Vibestations here in Montreal!

## Need to Level Up?

The fastest way to grow as a Solana developer is to build in public.

Contribute to open-source projects, learn from real codebases, and get your work noticed by the ecosystem.
